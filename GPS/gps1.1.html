            <h2> What is pair programming? </h2>
            <p> Pair programming is the process of working with another person to complete a challenge. The advantages of pair programming include: both people being able to learn from eachother, and having multiple perspectives. This makes troubleshooting easier! Also, working with others better prepares you for a real work environment in which you are expected to work with coworkers and clients.</p>

            <p> Driver: The person at the keyboard that is primarily in charge of translating the pair's ideas into working code.</p>
            <p> Navigator: The person in the group that dictates the ideas and helps guide the driver.</p>
            <p> While there are two separete roles, the two work together and help with each task. They are both equally important in completeing the project.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
              Pairing is something new to me and I can tell it will take some time to get the hang of it. But, I had a great time during this pairing session and can definitely see the benifits of it. I learned a lot about the design process simply by having someone there that approaced it from a different perspective.
