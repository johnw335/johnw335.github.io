        I have to be honest, this did not make sense at all to me for the longest time. I saw this diagram dozens of times and never took anything away from it.

        I just saw a bunch of boxes that didn't translate into anything I could actually write in CSS. It took a lot of trail and error for me to really see any difference in the
        four terms. But, after some work I see that it can be broken down really simply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content: That name gives this one away a little bit, but the content is the actual substance (maybe text or an image) that you are working with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Padding: Padding is the space between the content and the border. So, larger you make the padding, the more white space there will be around your content. It is written like this -->  whatever {
                        padding: 20px;  }
      </p>
      <p>
        Border: This is probably the part most people will understand first. The border is just what it sounds like... a border around the content and padding. You can adjust the width and color of the border like this --> whatever{
        border: 2px solid black;
      } This border would have a black border that is 2px wide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Margin: The final piece of this diagram is the margin. The margin is used to position everything within your border on your page. Increasing margin-left for example with move your box to the right. That would be written like this --> whatever {
                      margin-left: 20px;
      }
      </p>
      <p>
        I really hope that I explained that in a concise enough way. The whole box layout can be confusing at first, but after a little work it really clears up.
