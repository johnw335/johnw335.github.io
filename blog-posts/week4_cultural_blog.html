        Sexism has found a way to linger in the tech industry and doesn't seem like it's going anywhere soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2010 around 57% of the undergraduate degrees given out were to women, but only about 14% of the computer science degrees went to women. What's worse is that number is moving in the wrong direction, in 1985 that number (percentage of women computer science graduates) was closer to 37%.Within tech jobs, the numbers are not much better, only around 25% of jobs in the tech field are held by women.
      </p>
      <p>
        What can we do about this?
      </p>
      <p>
        There is one answer to this question. We need to find a way to change the tech culture at its core, to make it more appealing to women. The only way to chip away at this problem is to start educating people about the issue and the problems associated with it. As long as the tech world is a boys club, we will miss out on half of the worlds great problem solvers. I hope that I can find a way to make the tech world more comfortable for women and promote a comfortable and inviting work environment.
