    <div id="title">Let's talk about Values!</div>
    <div id="date">September 21st, 2014</div>
    <div id="text">
      <p>Our task for this blog entry was to look at a list of values and decide which we relate to our happiest and proudest moments. Then we are ranking each value based on how hard we try to live up to these values.</p>
      <p>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p>
      <p>Ok, lets pick some values out of the list.</p>
      <p>Ambition -- 4</p>
      <p>Confidence -- 2</p>
      <p>Creativity -- 3</p>
      <p>Growth -- 3</p>
      <p>Honesty -- 4</p>
      <p>Inner harmony --3</p>
      <p>Music -- 3</p>
      <p>Pleasure -- 4</p>
      <p>I really do feel like I am the most happy when I am bettering myself in some way. That's why I highlight values like ambition, growth, and confidence. But, at the end of the day, I believe that finding pleasure in life is extremely important. The music pick probably falls within pleasure, but I still felt like it was worth mentioning.</p>
      <p>I would love to work equally hard to live up to all of my values, but that is not an easy task. However, they are all interconnected and when progress is made with any, everything is pushed forward.</p>
      <p>It's hard to get to deep into personal values without an extended conversation, but I hope that I have demonstrated at least a quick snapshot.</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
