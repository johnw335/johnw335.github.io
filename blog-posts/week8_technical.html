      <p>Don't ask me why I decided to write a blog post about this.</p>
      <p>I chose it at random, but then became oddly interested in it.</p>
      <p>I had never really thought about the different ways that information could be sorted. I mean .. why would I?</p>
      <p>But, it turns out that there a three (that I know of) very different ways of soring information</p>
      <p>Explaining these in words would be a little confusing, so I will give each sorting method a quick intro and then show you two videos that will make you wish you just skipped what I wrote.</p>
      <p>Bubble Sort</p>
      <p>Bubble sort was the one that looked most logical to me at first glance. The program moves through the list that needs to be sorted and compares only two objects together. It picks the one the is the biggest(let's just use this as the example) and uses that as the comparison for the next comparison. It moves down the entire list this way until the list in in order. </p>
      <p>Quick Sort</p>
      <p>Quick sort works by picking an item in the list as the pivot. From my understang this can be any item in the list. The program then moves through the list comparing each item to the pivot. This will split the list into two separate lists (one on each side of the pivot) and then each of those wil lave to be sorted again.</p>
      <p>Merge Sort</p>
      <p>Merge sort only works when the two lists being sorted together are already sorted themselves. This may be hard for me to explain so I will leave this up to the videos below.</p>
    </p>Thses should help a lot!</p>

    <p>I hope you understand sorting a little better now! </p>
