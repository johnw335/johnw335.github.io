        Creating a class in Ruby allows you to create instances of specific objects. When I look at that sentence
        I get a little condused (even though I just wrote it). Let's try to break that down with an example.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-eclipse-rdt/fig02.jpg"/>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, this example is a little complex so we won't go through every piece of it. However, we can use this to see how classes work.
      </p>
      <p>
        We create a class "Employee" by simply writing Class Employee. Next we initalize the inputs we want to use with the @ symbol. This make them instance
        variables and usable throughout the entire class. Without the @ symbol they would be local variables and only usable within the method they are called.
      </p>
      <p>
        After this we create the methods we want to run within the Class. Let's look at def to_s. to_s will use the variables given and create a sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can call this by typing.
      </p>
      <p>new_employee = Employee.new("John", 40000, 2009) </p>
      <p>puts new_employee.to_s</p>
      <p>This will return, "Name is John, salary is 40000, hire year is 2009.</p>
      <p> The class allows us to create as many new employees as we need that can all be distinguished by their atributes.</p>
      <p>I hope this was a clear explanation of Ruby Classes and their importance.</p>
      <p>Thanks!</p>
