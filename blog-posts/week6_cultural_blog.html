    <div id="title">Stereotype Threat</div>

      <p>Honestly, this is an odd topic for me to approach.</p>
      <p>Being a white male in the southern United States, I kinda fall right in the middle of the majority. So, I don't think I have ever personally been effected by stereotype threat. </p>
      <p>However, I can see this being a problem within the tech world. </p>
      <p>Society has decided upon a pretty specific stereotype for memebers of the technology world. When people close their eyes and imagine a coder they probably all see someone who is...</p>
      <p> * Young </p>
      <p> * Male </p>
      <p> * White </p>
      <p> I mean, just take a look at these two graphs that look at the founders of companies that received seed funding in 2010.</p>

      <p>And now a break down racially.</p>

      <p>I am not sure how much has changed in the past few years since this study was done, but I would bet that it's not significant.</p>
      <p>With staggering numbers like this, it's really understandable that we are being asked to look into the subject. I really hope that DBC can make a dent in this issue by continuing to focus on creating graduates that understand the problem.</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
