        This week we are going to talk about JaveScript.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to lie, I was really confused by JavaScript when we first started working with it. I hit a lot of walls and spent a lot of time being frustrated with it. But, somehow, I ended up finsihing all of the challenges (and with more confidence each time). I'm finally starting to wrap my head around the language, so it's probably about time to figure out why JavaScript is worth knowing.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is currently one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It fits perfectly with HTML and CSS because it can be used to change HTML elements, attributes, and styles. It is know to be a relatively simple language to learn, while still being very powerful. The fact that it's so popular gives us an extra incentive to learn it. One of the main perks to the lanugage is its speed, it deploys on the client side so it doesn't need to wait for a server (I'm pretty sure I understand the last sentence I wrote).
      </p>
      <p> So far we can say that JavaScript is 1. Easy to learn 2. Fast and powerful 3. Used in a huge percentage of websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all of the research I did, I could only really find two cons to JavaScript. The first is that it is not the safest language. People with malicious intent can get through the language pretty easily. The second is that it may not get rendered in the exact same why on each browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I can see why JavaScript is one of the languages we are focusing on. It is all over the place and somewhat simple to learn. I am excited about diving into the language and seeing what it can really do.

        Thanks Everyone!
