        When I joined DBC I had no idea how important working with others would be. I usually work alone and thought that pairing would be a minor inconvenience.
      </p>
      <p>Little did I know that pairing would be such a great experience. One of the most frustrating parts of coding can be getting stuck on one issue for long periods of time.</p>
      <p> Pairing adds another set of eyes and another creative brain to challenge. It allows a group to bounce ideas off one another and build something stronger than either person would have created individually.</p>
      <p>That is one thing that I find particularly enjoyable about pairing. Seeing a solution that never would have crossed my mind helps me understand the code in a much more well rounded fashon.</p>
      <p> Now let's talk about feedback!</p>
      <p>I the the DBC community is pretty good about leaving positive and constructive feedback. I haven't been left any that left me discouraged or upset. One common thread in the feedback about me is that I need to me more vocal about my problem solving process. This isn't too surprising to me, and I know it's something that I need to work on. </p>
      <p>The only difficult thing about writing feedback has been finding something to criticize. I have only paired with really enthusiastic smart people and have loved every session. </p>
      <p> Pairing and feedback have both been very helpful in my growth as a coder. I can't believe how much I have gained from pairing especially.</p>
      <p>Well i'm off to leave some feedback...</p>
