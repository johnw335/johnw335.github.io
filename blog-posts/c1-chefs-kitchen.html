       I want to start by saying that I loved Shereef's talk. But I guess i'm here to talk about my view of DBC as a whole. To tell the truth... i'm terrified (definitly got some of that imposters syndrome going on), but that fear makes me think that this experience will be entirely worth it! If I can use that as an extra source of motivation then I just might make it. It will really just make the accomplishment all the more sweet. As for the culture, it seems it's like one of DBC's strongets points. I'm going into the program nervous, but also open minded and incrediby excited about what I can learn in just 18 weeks. I hope that I can contribute to the environment of DBC and help others just and much as I plan on reaching out for help. I really can't wait to check on everyone's blog posts over the next few days <strike>and steal some ideas</strike> to get some inspiration on how to spice mine up a bit. Good bye! It's time for me to be a chef and start creating. See you in week 2.
