      <p>How do I deal with conflict?</p>

      <p>This is the Compas of Shame, and it is supposed to show the range of
        ways people tend to deal with conflict and shame.</p>
      <p>I have been looking at it for a while now and I cant seem to pinpoint where my reactions fall.</p>
      <p>I can rule out the 'attack other' side of the compass, but I don't see
        and of the other options fitting perfectly either.</p>
      <p>My reaction would probably display a little bit from each of the north, east, and south positions.</p>
      <p> I would say that I tend to avoid conflict to the point of it being a fault, but when put in a situation where I am forced to deal with it I surprise myself.
      </p>
      <p>As for shame, it's not really an issue for me. I am very comfortable with myself and the positions I hold. I believe that shame arises when there is a disconnect between beliefs we want to hold, and the actions we take.</p>
      <p>I am sorry for the brevity of this post, but this topic is much more suited for an in debth conversation and not a post</p>
      <p>If anyone is ever interested in continuing this conversation, I am always happy to have it!</p>
      <p>See you next time.
      </p>
