    <div id="title">Inheritance vs Composition</div>

    <div id="text">
      <p>If I have learned anything from my reasearch on this topic, it's to only use Inheritance when you have to. Programmers tend to like Composition much more.
      </p>
      <p>But... we still need to know how to use both.</p>
      <p>Here is an example of Inheritance. (Here they also use super() which I will explain</p>
      <p><img src="http://tomajwinter.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/12.gif"/></p>
      <p>Here the class "Child" inherits from "Parent". So, you could call a method that exists in child or you can call a method from child that only exists in parent.</p>
      <p>... hmmm ... if you don't understand that, don't worry. It's my writing and not your abilty to get the concept. </p>
      <p>super() is a ruby method that will call the inherited information and then the information within the method called.</p>
      <p>This means that son.altered() will return</p>
      <p> >>CHILD, BEFORE PARENT altered()</p>
      <p> >>PARENT altered()</p>
      <p> >>CHILD, AFTER PARENT altered()</p>
      <p>Ok, before I get too stuck talking about Inheritance, we should talk a little about composition.</p>
      <p>Composition is a way of accomplishing the same goals without having to worry about the mess of inheritance. Inheritance works by just calling the functions you need within your class.</p>
      <p>We could use Composition in the example above by simply saying</p>
      <p>@parent = Parent.new </p>
      <p>while initilizing Child</p>
      <p>this way we can call methods from parent whenver we need them.</p>
      <p>I know this has been a simplistic explanation of the topic, but I hope you have taken something useful away from it. It seems like there is a time and place for each approach, but Composition is cleaner.</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading evertyone!</p>
